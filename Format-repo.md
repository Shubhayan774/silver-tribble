# Format of Creating a Repository

## Structure

1. **Title**: The format should begin with the title of the topic for which the repository is being created.

2. **Overview**: Provide a basic introduction to the topic, explaining its significance and purpose.

3. **Key Topics**: List the main headings that will be covered in the repository.

4. **Deep Dive Sections**: Each topic mentioned in the overview should be explored in detail across four levels of understanding:
   - **Teenager Level**: Use storytelling elements to make the concept relatable and easy to understand.
   - **Undergraduate Level**: Continue storytelling but introduce more technical depth with relevant examples.
   - **Master Level**: Provide an analytical approach, covering theoretical and practical aspects in depth.
   - **Professional Level**: Discuss advanced applications, best practices, and industry standards.

5. **Relevant Examples**: Include examples that have both national and international relevance to make concepts more tangible.

6. **Conclusion**: Summarize key takeaways and highlight the importance of the topic in the broader context of software development and collaboration.

This format should be followed consistently across all repository documentation to maintain clarity and coherence.
